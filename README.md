# SecurePassowrdGenerator

## Description

The webapge is a simple site that generates a random, secure password upon users request. When the function is called the user is prompted with series of promts in which they confirm what they want included in their password.

My motivation behind this project was to get familiar with the basic concepts of javascript in order to get more comfortable with the scematics in which I can potentially apply in my future projects and/or jobs.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
